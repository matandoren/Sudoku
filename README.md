This app is a Sudoku game that lets the user solve a puzzle that was either generated by the user or randomly generated by the app itself.
When the user solves a puzzle, the app evaluates the user's score based on the amount of hints and the time it took the user to solve the puzzle.
The app keeps track of the high scores and displays them every time a user solves a puzzle.
